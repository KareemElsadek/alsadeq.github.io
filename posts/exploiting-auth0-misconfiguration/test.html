    <title>Auth0 Misconfiguration Case Study</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Auth0</h1>

<p>During our comprehensive testing of the application, with my talented friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iknowhatodo/">Hossam</a>, we discovered and exploited this flow.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the realm of application security, authentication mechanisms play a pivotal role in safeguarding user data. Leveraging robust authentication services like Auth0 can significantly enhance security. However, misconfigurations within these services can introduce critical vulnerabilities. In this article, we delve into a recent discovery of a severe vulnerability related to Auth0 misconfiguration in an application we were testing. This write-up aims to shed light on the issue, the steps taken to identify and exploit it.</p>

<h2>Background: Understanding Auth0 and Social Logins</h2>

<p>Auth0 is a widely used authentication and authorization platform that simplifies the implementation of secure login systems. It supports various authentication methods, including social logins like Google, Facebook, and others. Social logins offer users the convenience of signing up and logging in using their existing social media accounts, reducing the friction of creating new credentials.</p>

<p>However, the integration of social logins requires meticulous configuration to ensure that user data is handled securely. Misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities such as account linking issues, where multiple accounts inadvertently reference the same user data.</p>

<h2>The Application Under Test</h2>

<p>The application in question limited user registration exclusively to Google accounts through the “Signup with Google” option. This singular authentication pathway streamlined the user experience but also concentrated the authentication process within a single framework — Auth0.</p>

<h2>Discovery of the Vulnerability</h2>

<p>During testing, we identified a significant vulnerability stemming from a misconfiguration in Auth0. The application exhibited unintended behavior when users attempted to create accounts using the same email address through different authentication methods.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Account Creation via Social Login</h3>

<p>We began by creating an account using the available “Signup with Google” option. This established the initial user profile within the application’s authentication system.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Attempting Email and Password Registration</h3>

<p>Next, we attempted to create a new account using the same email address (<code>testacc2399@gmail.com</code>). This indicated that the system allowed multiple accounts with the same email across different authentication methods, leading to potential data conflicts.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Verifying Account Linking</h3>

<p>To confirm whether the two accounts were linked or if the system fetched data based on the email, we performed the following actions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Accessing the Account via Email and Password:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Challenge:</strong> Initially, we faced a challenge: the application did not provide a direct page or interface to log in using email and password. The only available option was to log in via Google.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming the Challenge:</strong> To overcome this, we manipulated the authorization endpoint URL to force the authentication method to email and password: <code>https://{auth.app.xx}/authorize?client_id={Clientid}&amp;response_type=token&amp;connection={dbconnection}&amp;prompt=login&scope=openid%20profile%20phone&redirect_uri={redirect-uri}</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Accessing this modified URL prompted a login page where we could enter the email and password. Upon submission, the login redirected us to the original account created via Google, confirming that the system recognized both authentication methods as a single user profile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The case study on Auth0 misconfiguration and account linking vulnerabilities emphasizes the risks introduced by improper setup of authentication services. Despite using a robust platform like Auth0, misconfigurations in handling social logins and multiple authentication methods can result in unintended account linking, allowing unauthorized access to user data.</p>
