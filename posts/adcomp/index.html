A directory service for Windows enterprise environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization’s resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts.
The purpose of Active Directory is to enable organizations to keep their network secure and organized without having to use up excessive IT resources. For example, with AD, network administrators don’t have to manually update every change to the hierarchy or objects on every computer on the network. They simply do it once in Active Directory. It’s also necessary for managing security authentication.
